# React Task Manager

The react-task-manager app allows a user to add, remove, and save tasks to a reactive list by utilizing a localhost server.
The app uses React to build the user interface, Node to run the localhost server, and Bootstrap for additional formatting.

# Dependencies

This project uses npm and Node.js to run the app and create a reactive interface.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/) for CSS should also be downloaded

# Installation

Checking version of npm and Node.js:
node -v
npm -v

To install npm, Node.js, and bootstrap:

npm install -g npm
Node.js is available for installation at (https://nodejs.org/en/download).
npm install bootstrap

** Be sure to install npm and bootstrap in the root directory (react-task-manager) **
** Be sure to install node in the server file **

Before running the app, you should have two new folders with the following directories:
./react-task-manager/node_modules
./react-task-manager/server/node_modules

# Running the App

Once all dependencies are installed, in a terminal window:

cd react-task-manager
npm start

In a new terminal window:
cd react-task-manager/server
node server.js

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
